                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 15, 2025</p>

                <div class="policy-content">
                    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to Ghost Em ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we handle your information when you use our browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you have a safe and secure experience.</p>

                    <h3>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
                    <p>Ghost Em is built with a privacy-first approach. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. All operations performed by the extension occur locally in your browser.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect any personal identifiers such as your name, email address, or IP address.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Financial Data:</strong> We do not collect or handle any of your financial information.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Usage Data:</strong> We do not track your activity, including how you use the extension or which posts you delete.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Server Communication:</strong> The extension does not send any of your data to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. How the Extension Works</h3>
                    <p>Ghost Em operates entirely on your local machine. When you use the extension to delete Twitter/X posts, it interacts with the Twitter/X website's interface on your behalf. All actions are performed within your browser and are subject to your active Twitter/X session. Your data remains on your computer and is never sent to us.</p>

                    <h3>4. Permissions</h3>
                    <p>The extension requires certain permissions to function correctly, such as accessing the content of Twitter/X pages. These permissions are solely for the purpose of enabling the extension's features and are not used to collect any information about you. We only request the minimum permissions necessary for the extension to work.</p>

                    <h3>5. Data Retention</h3>
                    <p>Since we do not collect any of your data, we do not have any data to retain. All information related to your use of the extension is stored locally on your device and can be cleared by you at any time.</p>

                    <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
                    <p>Ghost Em does not integrate with any third-party services that would have access to your data. The extension works exclusively within your browser and does not share information with any other services.</p>

                    <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>
                    <p>Our extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

                    <h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it periodically. Your continued use of the extension after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.</p>

                    <h3>9. Contact Us</h3>
