            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 15, 2025</p>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Ghost Em ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our browser extension. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.</p>

            <h3>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
            <p>Ghost Em is designed to respect your privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data. All operations performed by the extension occur locally in your browser.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect your name, email, or any other personal identifiers.</li>
                <li><strong>No Usage Data:</strong> We do not track how you use the extension or which posts you delete.</li>
                <li><strong>No Server Communication:</strong> The extension does not send any data to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. How the Extension Works</h3>
            <p>Ghost Em operates entirely on your local machine. When you use the extension to delete Twitter/X posts, it interacts with the Twitter/X website's interface on your behalf. All actions are performed within your browser and are subject to your active Twitter/X session.</p>

            <h3>4. Permissions</h3>
            <p>The extension requires certain permissions to function correctly, such as accessing the content of Twitter/X pages. These permissions are solely for the purpose of enabling the extension's features and are not used to collect any information about you.</p>

            <h3>5. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it periodically.</p>

            <h3>6. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
